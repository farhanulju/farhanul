<h3>👋 Hi, I’m Farhanul. </h3>
<h4> I am not a coding wizard. I make changes to existing codes to make things work. </h4>


I'm currently managing [CubeNation](https://cubenationshop.com), a Bangladeshi Puzzle-only retail shop heavily targeted towards speedcubers. I raised this store from scratch and it's currently(2022) generating around 7M BDT revenue each year at a 26% yearly growth. I have done this by constantly testing and learning from consumer behavior. I have also created an efficient supply-chain for smooth operation. And the website? I built it on wordpress and optimized it as necessary. All of this was done effectively using great tools for project management. I primarily used Trello for Task handling, Google Sheets for cloud inventory, DigitalOcean for Server management, Jira for Agile Team management. I have roughly 6 years of experience in running a one-man-army organization. 2 years experience in managing and raising a team-driven organization. 1 year experience of project management in a reputed agile software development company. So I know a few stuff to make your business rise. 

<h4>TL;DR. </h4>
- 🧑‍💼 I work with SMEs to optimize their existing business operation using data-driven models.
- ✉️ Struggling with your business operation pipeline? I may be able to help help you. Reach me at 2017khan54@gmail.com
