# 👋 Welcome! I'm Farhanul

## About Me

Although I'm not a coding sorcerer, I do possess a knack for tweaking existing code to make magic happen.

### What I'm Up To

I'm at the helm of [CubeNation](https://cubenationshop.com), a Bangladeshi haven for puzzle enthusiasts and speedcubers alike. I've nurtured this venture from its infancy to a flourishing enterprise with an annual revenue of approximately 7M BDT, boasting a yearly growth rate of 19% as of 2023. 

My success stems from a relentless pursuit of understanding consumer behavior, coupled with an optimized supply chain that ensures seamless operations. And the secret behind our digital storefront? A WordPress site, fine-tuned by yours truly for peak performance.

### Tools of the Trade

Over the years, I've harnessed the power of several tools to streamline project management:

- Trello for task management
- Google Sheets for real-time inventory tracking at cost efficiency
- DigitalOcean for server administration
- Jira for agile team coordination

With 7 years of solo entrepreneurial experience and 2 years of team leadership, I've developed a robust skill set. My recent work, 1 year of project management at a renowned agile software development firm—has further solidified my expertise.

## TL;DR

- 🧑‍💼 I empower SMEs by refining their business operations with data-centric strategies.
- ✉️ If you're facing operational challenges, let's chat.
